            "choices": [
                "A tool waits to be picked up for specific tasks; a teammate actively collaborates, brainstorms, and provides feedback",
                "A tool is free but a teammate requires a paid subscription",

            "answer": 0,
            "explanation": (
                "The tool mindset treats AI as a passive instrument you "
                "pick up occasionally. The teammate mindset treats AI as "
                "an active collaborator — always available for execution, "
                "brainstorming, critique, and learning. Research shows "
                "this mindset shift is the key differentiator between "
                "underperformers and outperformers."

            "choices": [
                "When you are stuck and don't know what to do -- use it to brainstorm angles, explore consequences, and find direction",
                "Only when you need to write code or technical documents",
                "When you want the AI to make final decisions for you",
            ],
            "answer": 0,
            "explanation": (
                "The thought partner mode is for moments when you have "
                "no idea what to do. Instead of asking for a direct "
                "answer, you ask AI to brainstorm with you — exploring "
                "different angles, potential consequences, and creative "
                "approaches until you find the right path forward."

            "choices": [
                "It can explain the same concept in endless variations without getting frustrated",
                "It has access to every textbook ever written and can quote them directly",

                "A human teacher might get frustrated explaining the same "
                "concept five times. AI never will. It can explain quantum "
                "physics or a programming language as a poem, a dialogue, "
                "with analogies, or step-by-step — adapting endlessly "
                "until the concept clicks for you."
