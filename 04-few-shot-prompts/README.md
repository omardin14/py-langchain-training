# Few-Shot Prompts

This module introduces **Few-Shot Prompts** - providing examples to the model to help it understand the desired format and behavior.

<!-- lesson:page What are Few-Shot Prompts? -->
## What are Few-Shot Prompts?

Few-shot prompting is a technique where you provide the model with a few examples of the task you want it to perform. This helps the model:

- **Understand the format** - See how inputs and outputs should be structured
- **Learn the pattern** - Recognize the relationship between examples
- **Improve accuracy** - Better results by following the provided examples
- **Maintain consistency** - Produce outputs in the same style as the examples

## Concepts Covered

- **Few-Shot Prompting**: Providing examples to guide model behavior
- **Example Templates**: Structuring examples for the model
- **FewShotPromptTemplate**: LangChain's class for creating few-shot prompts

<!-- lesson:page How Few-Shot Prompts Work -->
## How Few-Shot Prompts Work

A few-shot prompt includes:

1. **Examples** - A list of input/output pairs showing the desired behavior
2. **Example Prompt** - A template that formats each example
3. **Suffix** - The actual question/task you want the model to complete
4. **Input Variables** - Variables that will be filled in when invoking

### Example Structure:
```
Example 1: Input → Output
Example 2: Input → Output
Example 3: Input → Output
---
Your Question: {input}
```

The model learns from the examples and applies the same pattern to your question.

## Understanding Few-Shot Prompt Structure

Let's break down how a few-shot prompt works:

```python
# Step 1: Define examples
examples = [
    {"input": "happy", "output": "joyful"},
    {"input": "sad", "output": "melancholy"},
    {"input": "angry", "output": "furious"}
]

# Step 2: Create a template for formatting each example
example_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template("Word: {input}\nSynonym: {output}")

# Step 3: Create the few-shot prompt template
prompt_template = FewShotPromptTemplate(
    examples=examples,
    example_prompt=example_prompt,
    suffix="Word: {input}",
    input_variables=["input"]
)
```

### Key Components:

1. **Examples List** - A list of dictionaries showing input/output pairs
2. **Example Prompt** - A template that formats each example consistently
3. **FewShotPromptTemplate** - Combines examples with your actual question
4. **Suffix** - The format for your actual input question

### The Flow:

```
Examples:
  Word: happy → Synonym: joyful
  Word: sad → Synonym: melancholy
  Word: angry → Synonym: furious
---
Your Question:
  Word: excited
```

The model sees the pattern and generates: "Synonym: thrilled"

## Code Examples

### Few-Shot Example (`few_shot_example.py`)

The example demonstrates:
- **Creating examples** as a list of dictionaries
- **Formatting examples** with an example prompt template
- **Building a few-shot prompt** with `FewShotPromptTemplate`
- **Using the prompt** with a model to get responses following the example pattern

## Key Benefits

| Feature | Zero-Shot | Few-Shot |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| **Examples Provided** | None | 2-5 examples |
| **Accuracy** | Good | Better (learns from examples) |
| **Format Consistency** | May vary | Follows example format |
| **Pattern Recognition** | Limited | Learns the pattern |
| **Use Case** | Simple tasks | Complex or specific formats |

## Prerequisites

This module builds on the concepts from **03-prompt-chains**. Make sure you've completed that module first.

### Setting Up Your Environment

**Complete Setup Steps:**

1. **Create the `.env` file** using the Makefile:
   ```bash
   make setup
   ```
   This creates a `.env` file from `.env.example` (or creates a template if it doesn't exist).

2. **Optional: Edit the `.env` file** and add your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-actual-api-key-here
   ```
   > **Note:** If you don't set an API key, the example will automatically use a Hugging Face model instead!

3. **Set up virtual environment and install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   make install
   ```
   This creates a Python virtual environment and installs all required packages.

**Model Selection:**
- **If `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set**: Uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model (highly recommended for few-shot prompts)
- **If `OPENAI_API_KEY` is not set**: Uses Hugging Face's local model (crumb/nano-mistral)
  - ⚠️ **Important**: Few-shot prompts work much better with OpenAI models. Smaller Hugging Face models often struggle to follow the example format correctly. For best results with few-shot prompting, strongly consider using an OpenAI API key.

**Alternative: Environment Variable**
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

> **Note:** The `.env` file is automatically loaded by the examples using `python-dotenv`. Make sure not to commit your `.env` file to version control!

## Installation

The Makefile automatically sets up a Python virtual environment and installs all dependencies. Simply run:

```bash
make install
```

This will:
1. Create a virtual environment (`venv/`) if it doesn't exist
2. Install/upgrade pip
3. Install all required dependencies from `requirements.txt`

> **Note:** The virtual environment is created automatically and all Makefile commands will use it. You don't need to activate it manually.

### Manual Installation (Alternative)

If you prefer to set up manually:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
# or
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Examples

### Using Makefile (Recommended)

The Makefile automatically uses the virtual environment:

```bash
# Run the example (creates venv and installs deps if needed)
make run

# Test your knowledge with the quiz
make quiz

# Complete the coding challenge
make challenge

# Or run directly
make all
```

> **Note:** The first time you run any command, it will automatically set up the virtual environment and install dependencies if needed.

### Manual Execution

If you set up the environment manually, activate it first:

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux

# Run example
python few_shot_example.py
```

## Test Your Knowledge

After running the examples, test your understanding with the interactive quiz:

```bash
make quiz
