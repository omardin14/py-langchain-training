# Prompt Chains

This module introduces **Prompt Chains** - connecting prompt templates with models using the pipe operator (`|`) in LangChain.

<!-- lesson:page What are Prompt Chains? -->
## What are Prompt Chains?

Prompt chains allow you to connect LangChain components together in a clean, readable way. The pipe operator (`|`) lets you:

- **Chain components** - Connect prompt templates directly with models
- **Simplify code** - Write `prompt | llm` instead of manual formatting and invocation
- **Build workflows** - Create reusable chains that can be invoked with different inputs
- **Maintain consistency** - Use the same pattern across different LangChain components

## Concepts Covered

- **Pipe Operator (`|`)**: The syntax for chaining LangChain components
- **Prompt Template Chaining**: Connecting prompt templates with LLMs
- **Chain Invocation**: How to invoke chains with input variables

<!-- lesson:page How Prompt Chains Work -->
## How Prompt Chains Work

A prompt chain connects a prompt template with a model using the pipe operator:

```python
# Create a prompt template
template = "You are a helpful AI assistant. Answer the question: {question}"
prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(template=template)

# Create a chain using the pipe operator
llm_chain = prompt | llm

# Invoke the chain
response = llm_chain.invoke({"question": "What is LangChain?"})
```

### Flow:
```
Input: {"question": "What is LangChain?"}
    ↓
[Prompt Template formats the template]
    ↓
Formatted: "You are a helpful AI assistant. Answer the question: What is LangChain?"
    ↓
[LLM processes the prompt]
    ↓
Output: Response from the model
```

## Understanding Prompt Chain Structure

Let's break down how a prompt chain works using our example:

### Step 1: Create a Prompt Template

Define a reusable template with variable placeholders using `{variable_name}` syntax:

```python
template = "You are a helpful AI assistant. Answer the question: {question}"
prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(template=template)
```

### Step 2: Create a Chain Using the Pipe Operator

Connect the prompt template with the model using the pipe operator (`|`):

```python
llm_chain = prompt | llm
```

### Step 3: Invoke the Chain

Pass a dictionary with variable values to run the chain. It automatically formats the template, sends it to the LLM, and returns the response:

```python
response = llm_chain.invoke({"question": "How does LangChain make LLM application development easier?"})
```

### Key Components:

1. **Prompt Template** - `PromptTemplate.from_template()`
   - Creates a reusable template with variable placeholders
   - Variables are defined using `{variable_name}` syntax

2. **Pipe Operator (`|`)** - Connects components
   - `prompt | llm` chains the prompt template with the model
   - The pipe operator is LangChain's way of connecting components

3. **Chain Invocation** - `.invoke()`
   - Takes a dictionary with variable values
   - Automatically formats the template → sends to LLM → returns response

<!-- lesson:page The Pipe Operator Pattern -->
### The Magic of the Pipe Operator:

The pipe operator (`|`) is a clean, Pythonic way to connect LangChain components. Instead of:
```python
# Manual approach (more verbose)
formatted = prompt.format(question="What is LangChain?")
response = llm.invoke(formatted)
```

You can write:
```python
# Chain approach (cleaner)
chain = prompt | llm
response = chain.invoke({"question": "What is LangChain?"})
```

## The Pipe Operator Pattern

The pipe operator (`|`) is a powerful pattern in LangChain that works with many components:

- `prompt | llm` - Chain prompt with model
- `prompt1 | prompt2 | llm` - Chain multiple prompts
- `chain1 | chain2` - Chain multiple chains together

This pattern makes it easy to build complex workflows from simple components!

## Code Examples

### Prompt Chain Example (`prompt_chain_example.py`)

The example demonstrates:
- **Creating a prompt template** with `PromptTemplate.from_template()`
- **Chaining the template with a model** using the pipe operator (`|`)
- **Invoking the chain** with `.invoke()` and a dictionary of variables
- **Understanding the flow** from template → model → response

<!-- lesson:page Key Benefits -->
## Key Benefits

| Feature | Without Chains | With Chains |
|---------|----------------|-------------|
| **Code Clarity** | Multiple steps, verbose | Single line: `prompt \| llm` |
| **Reusability** | Hard to reuse | Chain can be reused multiple times |
| **Maintainability** | Changes in multiple places | Update chain definition once |
| **Readability** | Less intuitive flow | Clear component connections |

## Prerequisites

This module builds on the concepts from **02-prompt-templates**. Make sure you've completed that module first.

### Setting Up Your Environment

**Complete Setup Steps:**

1. **Create the `.env` file** using the Makefile:
   ```bash
   make setup
   ```
   This creates a `.env` file from `.env.example` (or creates a template if it doesn't exist).

2. **Optional: Edit the `.env` file** and add your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-actual-api-key-here
   ```
   > **Note:** If you don't set an API key, the example will automatically use a Hugging Face model instead!

3. **Set up virtual environment and install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   make install
   ```
   This creates a Python virtual environment and installs all required packages.

**Model Selection:**
- **If `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set**: Uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model (recommended for best results)
- **If `OPENAI_API_KEY` is not set**: Uses Hugging Face's local model (crumb/nano-mistral)
  - ⚠️ **Note**: Smaller Hugging Face models may not follow instructions as precisely as OpenAI models. For best results, consider using an OpenAI API key.

**Alternative: Environment Variable**
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

> **Note:** The `.env` file is automatically loaded by the examples using `python-dotenv`. Make sure not to commit your `.env` file to version control!

## Installation

The Makefile automatically sets up a Python virtual environment and installs all dependencies. Simply run:

```bash
make install
```

This will:
1. Create a virtual environment (`venv/`) if it doesn't exist
2. Install/upgrade pip
3. Install all required dependencies from `requirements.txt`

> **Note:** The virtual environment is created automatically and all Makefile commands will use it. You don't need to activate it manually.

### Manual Installation (Alternative)

If you prefer to set up manually:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
# or
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Examples

### Using Makefile (Recommended)

The Makefile automatically uses the virtual environment:

```bash
# Run the example (creates venv and installs deps if needed)
make run

# Test your knowledge with the quiz
make quiz

# Complete the coding challenge
make challenge

# Or run directly
make all
```

> **Note:** The first time you run any command, it will automatically set up the virtual environment and install dependencies if needed.

### Manual Execution

If you set up the environment manually, activate it first:

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux

# Run example
python prompt_chain_example.py
```
